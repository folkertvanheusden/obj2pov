This program convertes wavefront .obj-files to something that can be rendered by povray.
The first release is still rather limited altough the minecraft obj-files produced by https://github.com/jmc2obj/j-mc-2-obj work quite well.

Usage:

    ./obj2pov.py -f inputfile.obj > outputfile.pov

Then you can render it with povray altough you may want to tweak the camera location and maybe add some more lights.

Example render: https://youtu.be/b0ljLMfLrgQ
